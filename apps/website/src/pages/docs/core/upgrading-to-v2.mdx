Saas UI 2.0 comes with a lot of new features and improvements. This guide will help you upgrade your existing Saas UI 1.x project to Saas UI 2.0.

## Upgrade Steps

### 1. Update dependencies

Make sure you use the latest Chakra UI version, minimum `2.5.0`.

```bash
npm i @chakra-ui/react@latest
```

### 2. Update Saas UI

<Info>Use @next while Saas UI 2.0 is in beta</Info>

```bash
npm i @saas-ui/react@next
```

### 3. New components

#### Timeline

The Timeline component has been moved from `pro` to the core package.

#### Sidebar

Sidebar is now out of beta and part of the core.

#### CommandBar

New CommandBar component.

### 4. Deprecated features

#### Button, ButtonGroup, IconButton, Menu, MenuItem

These components are no longer re-exported from Saas UI. You can import them directly from Chakra UI.

### 5. Breaking changes

#### Auth

Auth forms can now be used standalone, without using the Auth Provider.

- PasswordForm -> PasswordView
- OtpForm -> OtpView
- MagicLinkForm -> MagicLinkView
- UpdatePasswordForm -> UpdatePasswordView
- ForgotPasswordForm -> ForgotPasswordView
- `@saas-ui/auth/supabase` moved to `@saas-ui/supabase`
- `@saas-ui/auth/magic` moved to `@saas-ui/magic`

#### List

`List` has been renamed to `StructuredList` and has a new improved API.

```tsx
<StructuredList>
  <StructuredListItem>
    <StructuredListCell>
      <Text fontWeight="bold">Elliot Alderson</Text>
      <Text fontSize="sm" color="muted">
        Hacker
      </Text>
    </StructuredListCell>
    <StructuredListCell>
      <Tag>admin</Tag>
    </StructuredListCell>
  </StructuredListItem>
</StructuredList>
```

#### DataTable

`DataTable` has been updated to use React Table v8.

#### Form

- `Form` now accepts a render prop that gives you access to the internal form state, as well as typed Form components.

```tsx
export default function MyForm = () => {
  return (
    <Form defaultValues={{name: ''}}>
      {({Field}) => (
        <Field type="text" name="name" />
      )}
    </Form>
  )
}
```

- `AutoForm` has been removed, you can use `Form` instead. `Form` will auto render fields based on the schema you pass to it, when no children are provided.

- Importing `Form` from `@saas-ui/forms/yup` or `@saas-ui/forms/zod` gives you a typed `Form` component. No longer needed to use `useForm` or `getResolver`.

- `registerFieldType` has been renamed to `createField` and can be used together with `createForm` to create forms with custom fields.

```tsx
// form.tsx
import { createForm, createField } from '@saas-ui/react'

// zod
// import {createZodForm} from '@saas-ui/forms/zod'

// yup
// import {createYupForm} from '@saas-ui/forms/yup'

const MyCustomField = createField(
  React.forwardRef((props, ref) => {
    return <input ref={ref} {...props} />
  })
)

const MyCustomControlledField = createField(
  React.forwardRef((props, ref) => {
    return <ReactSelect ref={ref} {...props} />
  }),
  {
    isControlled: true,
  }
)

export const Form = createForm({
  fields: {
    custom: MyCustomField,
    'custom-controlled': MyCustomControlledField,
  },
})
```

#### Loader

`Loader` has been renamed to `LoadingOverlay` and has a new improved API.

```tsx
<LoadingOverlay>
  <LoadingSpinner />
</LoadingOverlay>
```

#### Sidebar

The `breakpoints` property is removed and Sidebar now accepts a single `breakpointValue` prop.
The `condensed` variant has been renamed to `compact`.

#### ErrorBoundary

ErrorBoundary `errorComponent` property renamed to `fallback` to be consistent with Suspense.
