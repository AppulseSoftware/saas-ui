As the Saas UI Pro we are working towards the official release there will be some breaking changes, which will be documented here.

## Upgrade Steps

### 1. Update dependencies

Saas UI Pro components have been moved to their own `@saas-ui-pro` organization in order to make it clear which packages are part of pro.

### 2. Update Saas UI Pro

```bash
npm i @saas-ui-pro/react @saas-ui-pro/feature-flags @saas-ui-pro/billing
```

### 4. Deprecated features

#### Timeline

Timeline has been moved to `@saas-ui/react`.

### 5. Breaking changes

#### Page

The `Page` component composition has been updated, it no longer renders PageHeader and PageBody, they should now be added as child components.

```tsx
<Page>
  <PageHeader title="Title" />
  <PageBody>Body</PageBody>
</Page>
```

#### Section

The `Section` component composition has been updated, it no longer renders SectionHeader and SectionBody, they should now be added as child components.

The `isAnnotated` property has been removed, instead use the `variant` property.

```tsx
<Section variant="annotated">
  <SectionHeader title="Title" />
  <SectionBody><SectionBody>
</Section>
```
