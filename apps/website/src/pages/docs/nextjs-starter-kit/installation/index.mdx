After [redeeming](/redeem) your license key you will receive an invitation to
the private Github repository and get access to the NPM registry.

The Saas UI Pro repository contains source code for all components and examples, as well as the Next.js starter kit.
Get started quickly by cloning the repository and running the demo application.

The Saas UI Pro packages are also available through our private NPM registry. This allows you to install them
in existing projects and also makes it easier to keep everything up to date.
