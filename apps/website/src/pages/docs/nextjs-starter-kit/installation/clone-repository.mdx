In case you have redeemed your license key and accepted the Github invite, you should now have access to the Saas UI Pro Git repository.

## Clone the repository

To clone the repository on your local machine, use the following command:

```bash
git clone --single-branch --branch=main git@github.com:saas-js/saas-ui-pro-nextjs-starter-kit.git my-project
```

This will clone the repository into the `my-project` folder, without the commit history.

## Setup Git

Now that you have cloned the repository, you can setup your Git configuration.

The `saas-ui-pro-nextjs-starter-kit` repository is configured as the `upstream` by default.
To add your own repository as the `origin`, use the following command:

```bash
git remote add origin git@github.com:your-username/your-repository.git
```

You can pull the latest changes from the `upstream` repository using the following command:

```bash
git pull upstream main --allow-unrelated-histories
```

As your codebase diverges from `saas-ui-pro-nextjs-starter-kit` you will run into merge conflicts eventually,
so at some point it might be easier to manually copy over any changes that you want to implement.

## Login to the private package registry

The Saas UI Pro packages are hosted on a private package registry (https://npm.saas-ui.dev).

After cloning the repository, log in to the private NPM registry with your license key.

- The `username` is the Github username you used to activate the license.
- The `password` is your license key that you received from Lemonsqueezy or Gumroad.

```bash
yarn npm login --scope saas-ui-pro --always-auth
```

## Install dependencies

This project uses `yarn 4` to manage dependencies, you can install all dependencies using the following command:

```bash
yarn
```

Yarn is shipped with the repository, so you don't need to install it globally.
If you run into installation issues, you can try to install the latest version of Yarn using the following command:

```bash
yarn set version latest
```

In case this doesn't work, enable corepack and run `yarn` again.

```bash
corepack enable
```

## PNPM support

If you prefer to use `pnpm` instead of `yarn`, you need to set up the `pnpm` workspace.

Create `.pnpm-workspace.yaml` in the root of your project with the following content:

```yaml
packages:
  - 'apps/*'
  - 'packages/*'
```

The recommended way to install PNPM is using `corepack`, you can enable `corepack` using the following command:

```bash
corepack enable
```

Install PNPM:

```bash
corepack prepare pnpm@latest --activate
```

Then run the following command to install all dependencies:

```bash
pnpm i
```

Make sure you also update the `scripts` in `package.json` to use `pnpm` instead of `yarn`.
