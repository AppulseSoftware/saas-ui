description: How to configure environment variables in the Saas UI Next.js starter kit.
---

The Saas UI Next.js starter kit uses environment variables to configure the application.
This allows you to separate configuration from your codebase and keep sensitive information secure.

## Configuration

<Info>
  We recommend _NEVER_ to check in any .env files in order to prevent leaking
  secrets into your Git repository. This is unlike [recommendations by
  Next.js](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/configuring/environment-variables#default-environment-variables),
  but we believe it is the better/safer approach.
</Info>

Environment variables should always be configured using your CI/CD provider. For example, GitHub Actions, Vercel, etc. Never store secrets in your repository.

You can copy the `.env.example` file to `.env` and fill in the values.

```bash
# Default plan id for new accounts.
# Plans are configured in `packages/config/billing.config.ts`.
DEFAULT_PLAN_ID=free@1

# Email
# The email address that will be used to send emails from the application.
# This domain must be verified in your email provider.
FROM_EMAIL="hello@saas-ui.dev"

# Database
# Uses a local docker instance by default.
DATABASE_URL=postgres://admin:admin@localhost:5432/dev

# Supabase (default Auth provider)
# You can find these values in your Supabase project settings.
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=
SUPABASE_SERVICE_KEY=

# Resend (default email provider)
# You can find this value in your Resend project settings.
RESEND_API_KEY=

# Stripe (default payment provider)
# You can find these values in your Stripe dashboard, under developer settings.
NEXT_PUBLIC_STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=
STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=
STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET=
```

## Using environment variables

All environment variables are defined using a Zod schema in `packages/env/env.ts`.
This allows us to validate the environment variables and give us type-safety / auto-completion in our codebase.

You can import environment variables from `env`:

```ts
import { env } from 'env'

console.log(env.DATABASE_URL)

// or

console.log(env.NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL)
```
