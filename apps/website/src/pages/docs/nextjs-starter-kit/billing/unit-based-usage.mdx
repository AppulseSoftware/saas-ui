Unit based usage (sometimes called seat based usage) is probably the most common usage type for SaaS applications, examples are:

- Users
- Seats
- Monthly active users (MAU)

The starter kit has built-in support for seat based usage and monthly active contacts.

## Registering usage

Usage of features is calculated in the `getFeatureCounts` function in the `billing` service.

The function is called with the billing account id and should return an object with the feature counts.

```ts
export const getFeatureCounts = async (args: { accountId: string }) => {
  return {
    users: 10,
  }
}
```

## Checking usage limits

TBD
