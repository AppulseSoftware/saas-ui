## Configure your auth screens

The auth screen configuration can be changed in `apps/web/config/auth.config.ts`

### 1. Authentication type

Here you can change your preferred authentication type, `magiclink` or `password`.

```ts
authType: 'password'
```

### 2. Oauth providers

And the OAuth providers you want to use. Set `authProviders` to undefined to hide social login.

```ts
authProviders: {
  google: {
    icon: FaGoogle,
    name: 'Google',
  },
  github: {
    icon: FaGithub,
    name: 'Github',
  },
}
```

## Customize the auth screens

### Login screen

The login screen is located in `apps/web/features/auth/login/login-page.tsx`.

### Signup screen

The signup screen is located in `apps/web/features/auth/signup/signup-page.tsx`.
