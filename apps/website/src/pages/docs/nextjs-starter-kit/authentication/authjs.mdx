NextAuth is a popular authentication solution for Next.js applications.
It supports many different authentication providers and is easy to
configure.

NextAuth v5 is the default authentication provider for the Next.js starterkit
and is configured using Resend (email) provider.

## Configure

The NextAuth configuration is located in `packages/auth-authjs/src` and is split up
into two files:

- `config.ts` - The edge compatible configuration, used in Next.js middleware.
- `auth.ts` - The main NextAuth configuration.

Please refer to the [NextAuth documentation](https://authjs.dev/getting-started/authentication) for more
information on how to configure NextAuth.
