Once you have cloned the repository and installed the dependencies, you can run the application with the following commands:

```bash
# Run the local database and push the schema
docker-compose up && yarn db:push
```

Followed by:

```bash
yarn dev:web
```

This will start the Next.js application on `http://localhost:3000`.

## Authentication

To log in you need to configure the authentication provider, by default the application uses Supabase.

To configure Supabase, create a `.env.local` file in the `apps/web` directory with the following content:

```bash
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=https://your-supabase-url.supabase.co
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your-supabase-anon-key
SUPABASE_SERVICE_KEY=your-supabase-service-key
```
