A procedure is a function that is exposed to the client, it can be one of:

- a `Query` - used to fetch data.
- a `Mutation` - used to modify data.
- a `Subscription` - used to listen to data changes.

## Base procedures

Reusable base procedures is a pattern that allows you to define a set of procedures that can be reused across multiple services.

The starterkit ships with a set of base procedures that you can use to get started.

- `publicProcedure` - a procedure that is available to all clients.
- `protectedProcedure` - a procedure that is available to authenticated clients.
- `workspaceProcedure` - a procedure that is available to clients that are part of a workspace.
- `adminProcedure` - a procedure that is available to clients that are an admin of a workspace.

## Define a Query

A query is used to fetch data from the server.

```ts
import { z } from 'zod'

import { publicProcedure } from '#trpc'
```
