description: How to configure environment variables in the Saas UI Pro Next.js starterkit.
---

The Saas UI Pro Next.js starterkit uses environment variables to configure the application. This allows you to separate configuration from your codebase and keep sensitive information secure.

## Configuration

We distuingish between shared and secret environment variables. Shared environment variables are shared between environments (dev/staging/prod) are stored in the `apps/web/.env`. They should not contain any secrets and can be checked into version control.

Secret environment variables are stored in the `apps/web/.env.local` file and _NEVER_ be checked into version control.

Public environment variables are prefixed with `NEXT_PUBLIC_` and are available to the client and server.

## `.env` file

The `.env` file contains shared environment variables and is checked into version control.

```bash
## Default plan id for new accounts
DEFAULT_PLAN_ID=free@1

## Email
FROM_EMAIL="hello@saas-ui.dev"
```

## `.env.local` file

The `.env.local` file contains secret environment variables and should _NEVER_ be checked into version control.

You can copy the `.env.local.example` file to `.env.local` and fill in the values.

```bash
## Database
DATABASE_URL=postgres://admin:admin@localhost:5432/dev

## Supabase (default Auth provider)
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=
SUPABASE_SERVICE_KEY=

## Resend (default email provider)
RESEND_API_KEY=

## Stripe (default payment provider)
NEXT_PUBLIC_STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=
STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=
STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET=
```

## Secrets

Secrets should always be configured using your CI/CD provider. For example, GitHub Actions, Vercel, etc. Never store secrets in your repository.

Below you'll find instructions on where to find secrets for all services used.

### Supabase

- `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL`: Find this in your Supabase project settings.
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`: Find this in your Supabase project API settings.
- `SUPABASE_SERVICE_KEY`: Find this in your Supabase project API settings.

### Resend

- `RESEND_API`: Find this in your Resend project settings.

### Stripe

- `NEXT_PUBLIC_STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY`: Find this in your Stripe dashboard.
- `STRIPE_SECRET_KEY`: Find this in your Stripe dashboard.
- `STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET`: Find this in your Stripe webhook settings.
